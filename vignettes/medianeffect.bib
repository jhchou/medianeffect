  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy may achieve a complete response (i.e., no sign of tumor following treatment) in 70\%-80\% of patients with germ cell tumors. However, only a minority of patients in whom the firstline regimens fail are cured with the salvage regimens.
PURPOSE: The aim of these studies was to identify new agents or new regimens for the treatment of germ cell tumors by carrying out quantitative assessment in vitro of two promising new antitumor agents (paclitaxel [Taxol] and topotecan) and three more established agents (cisplatin, vincristine, and etoposide). These agents were used singly or in two- and three-drug combinations and were selected because they represent five distinct categories of antineoplastic mechanisms.
METHODS: The combination index-isobologram method, which is based on the median-effect principle developed by Chou and Talalay, was used for computerized data analysis. This method was selected because it takes into account both the potencies of each drug and combinations of these drugs and the shapes of their dose-effect curves.
RESULTS: Synergism against the growth of teratocarcinoma cells resistant to cisplatin (833K/64CP10 cells) was greater than against the growth of parent 833K cells. The degrees of synergism were in the following order: cisplatin + topotecan {$>$} or = paclitaxel + cisplatin + topotecan {$>$} paclitaxel + topotecan {$>$} or = paclitaxel + etoposide {$>$} paclitaxel + cisplatin + etoposide {$>$} paclitaxel + cisplatin. All other combinations showed nearly additive effects or moderate antagonism. The degrees of antagonism were as follows: cisplatin + etoposide {$>$} or = paclitaxel + vincristine {$>$} paclitaxel + cisplatin + vincristine {$>$} cisplastin + vincristine. The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin was synergistic against 833K/64CP10 cells and moderately antagonistic against 833K cells. Since the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan and the two-component combinations of these drugs (cisplatin + topotecan and paclitaxel + topotecan) showed synergism stronger than that of other combinations, these three drugs were selected for illustrating detailed data analysis, using a computer software program developed in this institute.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that, as a result of synergy, the doses of these agents needed to achieve an antitumor effect may be reduced by twofold to eightfold when these agents are given in combination. The present quantitative data analyses for synergism or antagonism provide a basis for a rational design of clinical protocols for combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced germ cell tumors.},

  abstract = {A generalized method for analyzing the effects of multiple drugs and for determining summation, synergism and antagonism has been proposed. The derived, generalized equations are based on kinetic principles. The method is relatively simple and is not limited by whether the dose-effect relationships are hyperbolic or sigmoidal, whether the effects of the drugs are mutually exclusive or nonexclusive, whether the ligand interactions are competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive, whether the drugs are agonists or antagonists, or the number of drugs involved. The equations for the two most widely used methods for analyzing synergism, antagonism and summation of effects of multiple drugs, the isobologram and fractional product concepts, have been derived and been shown to have limitations in their applications. These two methods cannot be used indiscriminately. The equations underlying these two methods can be derived from a more generalized equation previously developed by us (59). It can be shown that the isobologram is valid only for drugs whose effects are mutually exclusive, whereas the fractional product method is valid only for mutually nonexclusive drugs which have hyperbolic dose-effect curves. Furthermore, in the isobol method, it is laborious to find proper combinations of drugs that would produce an iso-effective curve, and the fractional product method tends to give indication of synergism, since it underestimates the summation of the effect of mutually nonexclusive drugs that have sigmoidal dose-effect curves. The method described herein is devoid of these deficiencies and limitations. The simplified experimental design proposed for multiple drug-effect analysis has the following advantages: It provides a simple diagnostic plot (i.e., the median-effect plot) for evaluating the applicability of the data, and provides parameters that can be directly used to obtain a general equation for the dose-effect relation; the analysis which involves logarithmic conversion and linear regression can be readily carried out with a simple programmable electronic calculator and does not require special graph paper or tables; and the simplicity of the equation allows flexibility of application and the use of a minimum number of data points. This method has been used to analyze experimental data obtained from enzymatic, cellular and animal systems.},

Many methods have been used to evaluate interaction between drugs to date. Isobologram analysis has been mathematically proven and widely used to evaluate drug interactions. In this paper, the principle of isobologram analysis and its application in drug interaction evaluation are summarized. The applications of the similar cotoxicity coefficient and fractional inhibitory concentration index in the evaluation of drug interaction are also reviewed. This work is expected to evaluate the effect of formulations scientifically and provide scientific judgment standards for the development of formulations and clinical drug compatibility.},
